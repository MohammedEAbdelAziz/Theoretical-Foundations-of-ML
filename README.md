# Description
Some Machine Learning Projects that I built during my study of the theoretical foundations of Machine Learning

## Assignment 1
Used the Bayes Classifier on the iris dataset

## Assignment 2
Used Linear Regression on data generated by the `make_regression` function

## Project
Used the [Japanese Airlines Reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/japanese-airlines-reviews/data) to train a sentiment analysis model
